## 📖 GAME MANUALS

<details>
<summary><b>🧮 Calculator — "It's giving main character energy"</b></summary>

<br>

You asked for a calculator. We delivered a **sleek, dark-themed calculator** that slaps harder than it has any right to.

- Full arithmetic: `+` `−` `×` `÷`
- Expression preview on the display
- Chained operations
- Keyboard support (because clicking is for casuals)

**Pro tip:** Hit `Escape` to clear, `Backspace` to undo a digit. You're welcome.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🐍 Number Snake — "Just one more round..." (Famous last words)</b></summary>

<br>

Classic snake with a twist — the food has **numbers** on it, and eating them adds that value to your score. A `9` is worth more than a `1`. Choose wisely.

- Grows with every bite 🍽️
- Walls and self-collision = instant regret
- Best score saved to `localStorage` (survives browser restarts, unlike your dignity)
- Smooth gradient snake body because aesthetics matter

**Pro tip:** The snake can't reverse direction. Plan ahead or perish.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>✕ Tic Tac Toe ○ — "Friendship Destroyer™"</b></summary>

<br>

Pass-and-play Tic Tac Toe for two players sharing one screen. A **pass screen** hides each player's move, keeping the suspense alive (we're watching you, sneaky-peekers).

- Running score tracker across rounds
- Winning cells pulse green ✨
- Reset scores button for when things get too real
- Animated pass screen between turns

**Pro tip:** Center square. Always. That's the whole tip.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🐔 Chicken Crossing — "Why did the chicken cross the road?"</b></summary>

<br>

To get to the **🏁 FINISH LINE**, obviously. But there's a highway of absolute chaos between the chicken and glory.

- 8 lanes of traffic going both ways at different speeds
- Move **one step at a time** — up, down, left, right
- 3 lives. Lose them all = game over. Brutal.
- Best score saved locally
- Mobile D-pad overlay for on-the-go anxiety

**Pro tip:** Diagonal thinking doesn't exist here. Pick your lane, commit, and pray.

</details>

## 🎮 CONTROLS

Every game supports **keyboard**, **mouse/tap**, and **on-screen D-pad** (mobile).

| Action | Keyboard | Mobile |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Move Up | `↑` or `W` | ▲ D-pad |
| Move Down | `↓` or `S` | ▼ D-pad |
| Move Left | `←` or `A` | ◀ D-pad |
| Move Right | `→` or `D` | ▶ D-pad |
| Calculator input | Number keys, `Enter`, `Esc`, `Backspace` | Tap buttons |

> 🗒️ D-pad is a **translucent overlay** on top of the game canvas — it stays out of the way on desktop, but becomes your best friend on mobile.
